# Welcome to my project for RevoU assingment. 

## In this assignment, I am creating a website that consist of HTML, CSS, and JS file.

Here are the steps of creating them from scratch:

**1. Build the structure in HTML.**
> The first step is building the structure in HTML. This step important because the HTML is the core of this assignment. This is done by using VSCode to create the content of the website. The use of semantic HTML is also required.

**2. Create styling in CSS.**
>    After the creation of the core is completed, it is important to use styling in the CSS so people could use the website properly. There are several things need to be applied in CSS for this assignment, such as:
>>  *. Transition and animation.
    *. The use of grid.
    *. The use of object fit on images

**7. Use custom domain.**
>    The last step is to use custom domain purchased in Niagahoster. Setting several things such as DNS and the domain name are included in these steps.

>>  Buy the domain at Niagahoster or any other provider. Any domain can be  search and Niagahoster will automatically generates any possible domain name.

    After purchasing the domain. Setting the DNS is required in order to make the custom domain work. Go back to Netlify and choose Domain Management at the project overview.

    After adding custom domain, DNS need to be set. Go to options and go to DNS Panel

    Go back to Niagahoster and change the DNS shown on Netlify.

    Go check the domain management after setting the DNS. It might take a while for the DNS to be set up. Once it is checked. Then the site is ready to deploy with the custom domain
